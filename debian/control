Description: GNU R package providing basic robust statistics
 This package provides 'essential' robust statistics. The goal of the 
 package is to provide tools allowing to analyze data with robust methods.  
 This includes regression methodology including model selections and 
 multivariate statistics where the authors strive to cover the book 
 "Robust Statistics,  Theory and Methods" by Maronna, Martin and Yohai; 
 Wiley 2006.
